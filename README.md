This repository shows off my search algorithms and heuristics for PacMan. Inside of searchAgents.py, you will find my implementations of breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS) and A* search, as well as my implementations for a heuristic to visit all corners and a heuristic to visit all food on the grid. Additionally, you can find a proof for my arbitrary food heuristic in the main directory (proof.txt).

I received 26/25 on this assignment.
